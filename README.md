## Comments / Design discussion

The battery and power management circuitry was designed around the following ICs:

 * BQ24075 for LiPo charging
 * TPS63031 for (3.3V) voltage regulation

This can be considered as a relatively advanced design, in comparison with the "classical" TP4056 + DW01A + LDO combination, but is also far from perfect:

This was taken as a learning opportunity, and performance improvement (in terms of power efficiency), if any, has not been assessed, and is probably not worth the extra cost and design complexity.
This is especially true for the use of a Buck-Boost converter, as the gain in extra power recovery from the battery should be limited (to max 5% capacity wrt a simpler Buck, or even a good quality LDO linear regulator).

I would however always recommend the use of high-quality components when it comes to LiPo battery management...

Other design limitations:
 * The lack of a LED tied to an IO of the MCU module, making it impossible to (externally) identify when the device is in bootloader mode.
 * The two available LEDs are used for power management / battery charging are sandwiched between the PCB and the switch plate, thus not replaceable once the board is assembled.

No PCBA files are provided since the few proto boards were assembled by hand (human PnP and reflow oven).

## Battery

The cutout in the PCB has been designed to accomodate a **402535** LiPo battery (~300mAh), sandwiched between switch & bottom plates.
