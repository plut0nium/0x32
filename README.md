0x32 is a new design but inspired by boards like:
 - Hadron by Ishtob
 - Boardwalk by AlexAtPanc, Shensmobile & others
 - Planck (Light) by OLKB
 - Pancake by Spaceman
 - ...some if my previous designs ðŸ˜„

And special thanks to ebastler for providing information I used as reference design for Holyiot modules.
